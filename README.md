# Summoner

This project will consist of a collection of configurable geometric abstractions.  The ultimate goal is to build a flexible system for users to define their own geometric abstractions by adding constraints to a random process.

### Three squares

The first piece is based on a piece of artwork I saw at the Metropolitan in New York.  Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the artist.  The main motif was a large square with two smaller squares inscribed in it.   By clicking on any of the elements the user toggles a mode where they can change the parameters.  Moving the mouse over the square with two inscribed squares within changes the positions of the inscribed squares.  Moving the mouse over the bars to the left changes the colors.

### Triangulate

We generate a random triangulation of a square (with some internal vertices).  The user may click on edges to mutate the triangulation.
